"gcc -o cash cash.c -lm -I.. -L.. -lcs50"

-lm is for adding the math.h standard library which I'm adding for the floor function
-I.. is telling compiler to look at parent directory to find my copy of cs50.h header file
-L.. is telling compiler to look at parent directory to find my archive libcs50.a file
-lcs50 says to use libcs50.a (you omit the "lib" and us "-l" in front of the library name which is cs50.a)
