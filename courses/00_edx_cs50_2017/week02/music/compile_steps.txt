ok so I couldn't get make to work locally even after installing clang.

I added cs50.c and cs50.h into this local directory.

I've been able to compile wav.c with:

    gcc -c wav.c -I .

I can also compile helpers.c with:

    gcc -c helpers.c -I .

and finally cs50:

    gcc -c cs50.c -I .

then I create the library for music:

    ar rcs libmusic.a cs50.o helpers.o wav.o

and finally compile notes.c:

    gcc -o notes notes.c -I . -L . -lmusic -lm

Note that you still need to add the link to the math library.
