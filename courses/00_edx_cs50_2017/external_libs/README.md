# Linking Local Libs

The cs50 course wants us to use their cloud IDE which is fine, but I'd like to do most of this work locally to gain a better understanding of the technical implementation details.

from cs50 / libcs50 repo - commit: 2eccace2089b9342ff118262390b0579c9a72f2f on October 23 2017

The main goal here is to learn how linking works with local libraries. I want a fundamental understanding of where standard libraries are located by default and how to create my own local libraries and use them at compile time with gcc.

These are two very useful resources for learning these concepts:
