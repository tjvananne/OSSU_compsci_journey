# K&R - C Programming

I picked up the second edition of this book (copyright 1988 - before I was born) to gain a better understanding of how computers and memory management work. This works out well since CS50 (the first course in OSSU) has us learning C from the beginning. They offer a cloud environment and some pre-packaged libraries that hide some of the raw C functionality. I'm looking to complete the course with as little use of their packages as possible. I may end up using their packages and then go back and see if I can do it with raw C code.

## Sections I'm Skipping

Not all sections of this book are immediately valuable to me. It reads much more like a reference manual than a cover-to-cover tutorial book. Things like bit-wise operations I might skip just to make sure I'm focusing on things like standard IO, functions, arrays, and how to work with strings and convert data types.

Ultimately, I'm using this book as a guide to help me through some of the CS50 stuff I'm taking on that their cloud platform abstracts away, so those areas will be where I focus.
