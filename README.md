# OSSU_compsci_journey
This is my repo dedicated to documenting my journey through the OSSU computer science learning track. https://github.com/ossu/computer-science 


## Personal Rules

I may need to update these rules as I progress through the course work, but these are my initial guidelines:

1. Under no circumstances will there be more than 1 side project and 1 MOOC/course being worked on at the same time 
	* discipline and structure are (unintuitively) critial to creativity and freedom
	* must build a solid foundation of knowledge/experience which will help with future projects
2. Do not move on from a concept until it is fully understood
	* I may need to move on temporarily from concepts I don't fully understand because they will become more clear later on in the course, but I shouldn't finish the course without coming back to understand all concepts
3. Don't skip a course or portion of a course because you think you're "above" it or you already have mastered that content
	* There is always something to be gleaned from reviews. I also don't believe I built up my current knowledge in a sustainable way - which could hinder my ability to apply that knowledge to real life experiences.

	
## Current course:

I'll put basic information on my current course (such as timeline) here, then move it to a course-specific directory as I complete courses.

#### edx cs50 2017

* **start date**: 2/3/2017
* **planned finish date**: 4/27/2017
* **objective**: Much of this will be review, but I'm hoping to build a fundamental understanding of how computers (memory management, specifically) work through learning C.
